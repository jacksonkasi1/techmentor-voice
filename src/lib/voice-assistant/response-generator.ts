DOCUMENTATION:

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the EXACT code examples and information from the documentation above
2. If the documentation shows Better Auth examples, use those (not NextAuth.js)
3. Include actual code snippets from the documentation
4. Be specific about the library versions and setup steps shown in the docs
5. Reference the specific libraries: ${libraries.join(", ")}
6. If the documentation covers the user's question, provide a complete answer with code examples
`
    : "No specific documentation found."

Provide a detailed, technical response using the documentation above:`;
